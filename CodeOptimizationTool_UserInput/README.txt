# Code Optimization Tool

This Python tool analyzes user-pasted Python code, identifies performance bottlenecks (such as recursion), and suggests optimizations. It measures execution time before and after optimization and provides a performance report.

## Features:
- Analyzes Python code for performance bottlenecks.
- Provides optimization suggestions such as memoization or iteration.
- Measures execution time before and after optimization.
- Generates a detailed performance report.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Download the project files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder containing the project.
5. Run the command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
6. Paste your Python code when prompted and press Enter on an empty line to finish input.

## Example Output:
- Execution Time Before Optimization
- Optimization Suggestions
- Suggested Optimized Code Snippet
- Execution Time After Optimization
- Performance Report showing improvement percentage

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
